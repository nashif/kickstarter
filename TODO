List of things to do:

 - Add support for build IDs (partially done)
 - Multi arch repos (partially done)
 - Support kickstart magic
   Add addition options per image to describe how it should be created, i.e. image type and other options
   The generated kickstart files should then have the line on top that can be evaluated by mic 
 - Make it act as a module, so it can be imported into other scripts and generate kickstart file
 -
